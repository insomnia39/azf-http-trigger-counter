#How To
1. Copy the index.js file and drop it into the main folder where your Azure Function project lives.
2. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and point it at that same project folder.
3. Type "node index.js" and press Enter. This will make the script scan all the files and folders in your project.
4. You'll get two new files: results.json and output.csv.
